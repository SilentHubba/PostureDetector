# PostureDetector
Detects whether or not my posture is bad. Sends a MacOS notification to the user if it is.

Takes pictures of good and bad posture, trains a model to detect the difference, and predicts it with the camera.

On MacOS, I also made it repeat the check every 15 minutes and alert me when my posture is bad. Uses an unlisted shell script for that.
